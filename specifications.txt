                      Example: length = 2 -> 00 01 02 ... 99

-names Name1 Name2 Name3 -> Produces passwords based on NameN and their combination
                            Example: Name1AndName2, Name1&Name2, Name1Name2

-addSpecialEnd specialString -> Adds option which adds permutations with special string at the end

Recommended Usage: Generate Dates first and run attack against dates - the easiest and most popular passwords
                   Generate Digits passwords - When the router gets set up companies may give it digital password
                   If none of those 2 worked -> best of luck trying to Brute Force not a dummy user with other options
